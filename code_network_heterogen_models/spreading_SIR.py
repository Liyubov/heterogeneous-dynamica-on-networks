## Spreding on networks 


The main resources on spreading on networks can be found in [1].
We start with the simplest class of spreading, viral spreading on a network. This is a similar process to what you might observe in the case of rumor or inovation spreading in a social network. At each step, the "healthy" 
neighbors of any of the infectious nodes gets infected with fixed probability beta.

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models 
(population), and many models are derivations of this basic form. 
The model consists of three parts or compartments â€“ S for the number susceptible, I for the number of infectious, and R for the number recovered (or immune). This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human, 
and where recovery confers lasting resistance, such as measles, mumps and rubella. 
The SIR model is described by differential equations which we simulate below.
