# Heterogeneous dynamics on networks


Here I put the code for analysis of dynamics on networks:

# Heterogeneous epidemics spreading

I upload the code for epidemics spreading, which was developed during the internship with my students in 2019 at CRI.
More details about the project are uploaded here with the presentation, which Aurelie did and the introduction

# Heterogeneous random walk on network 

This is another project, which we are working with my colleagues from Ecole Polytechnique.
More details about the articles about Heterogeneous Continuous time random walk model  are here
