# Heterogeneous dynamics on networks


Here we include code for analysis of dynamics on networks:
1. Heterogeneous epidemics spreading
2. Heterogeneous random walk on network  

## Heterogeneous epidemics spreading

I upload the code for epidemics spreading, which was developed during the internship with my students in 2019 at CRI.
More details about the project are uploaded here with the presentation, which Aurelie did and the introduction from Gael Simon

## Heterogeneous random walk on network 

This is another project, which we are working with my colleagues from Ecole Polytechnique (in the group of Dr.Denis Grebenkov from Laboratoir of Condensed Matter Physics). Code is available in Matlab.

More details about our articles and computation of the propagator for Heterogeneous Continuous time random walk model can be found in

In our article we explain more about continuous time random walk models on networks
